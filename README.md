# Personal website - Victor Persson
Built using SASS, SCSS and JavaScript
 #### NOTE: This GitHub repository is uploaded by a developer for developers. The idea is to showcase my workflow, file structure and tools I use when coding. Therfore there will be no finalized or minimized .css file, hence all the SCSS and SASS files. 
 ---
#### How to open in "dev mode":
<ol>
  <li>Clone the GitHub repo</li>
  <li>Head on over to your terminal/CMD, navigate to the relevant repo folder/dic</li>
  <li>Write $ 'npm install' (this will install all the various dependencies you need to work with the files - you can review them in the package.json file)</li>
  <li>Back in your termial/CMD write, $ 'npm run victor' (This will start a local live-server in your browser, while also compiling the SASS files so that you may edit the code)</li>
 </ol>
